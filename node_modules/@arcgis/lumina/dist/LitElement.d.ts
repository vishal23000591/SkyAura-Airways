 * - Connects to the Controller Manager
 * - Provides load/loaded lifecycle hooks
 *   (like componentWillLoad and componentDidLoad in Stencil)
 * - Provides a .listen() method like Stencil's \@Listen decorator
 *

 * Even though all components will extend this class, it is not exposed in the
 * public typings as we do not want to expose internal methods like
 * addController() and connectedCallback() to the public typings.
 *
 * Instead, `@arcgis/lumina-compiler` will make it appear that your component
 * extends `PublicLitElement`.
 *
 * `PublicLitElement` will never be called at runtime - it exists for typings
 * only.
