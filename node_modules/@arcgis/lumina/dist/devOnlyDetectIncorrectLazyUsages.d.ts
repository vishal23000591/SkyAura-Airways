 * In practice, this means using this.el.getAttribute() instead of
 * this.getAttribute() and etc for each DOM method.
 *
 * To detect incorrect usages, this function overwrites each DOM member on the
 * LitElement prototype with an exception-throwing function.
 *
 * This code does not ship in production builds.
